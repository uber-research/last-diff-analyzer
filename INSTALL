# Install

As stated in the REQUIREMENTS document, modern bazel and gcc are required for running tests on Last-Diff Analyzer. 

Installing bazel and gcc depends on your OS and distro, and you can find the instructions from your distribution provider or generally at https://bazel.build/ and https://gcc.gnu.org/install/.

Alternatively, you can install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and run the tests via docker instead.
